## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
= SOA or Service Oriented Architecture is defined as a software development model that makes use of services to build a business software applications such as web applications. This architecture also defined as loosely coupled, as it interconnects, separate and reuse multiple services in creating applications that makes this architecture independent from technologies and platforms.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
-1. Standardized service contract - this guarantees that services must maintain and stick to the same design standards.
-2. Loose coupling - this characteristic of SOA is to create system where components were independent from each other.
-3. Abstraction - this characteristic of SOA tends to hide the logical design details from outside where consumers can easily implement interface services.
-4. Reusability - this characteristic of SOA makes the architecture less coss from unnecessary creating a system all over again for alteration and reform.
-5. Autonomy - SOA interacts functionally where services are independent from other services, making autonomous access.
-6. Statelessness - SOA provides state management qualities to support published services.
-7. Discoverability - To promote better usage of the service, the system should provide as much information as possible and inform the user on how to interact with it properly.
-8. Composability - this give consumers the opportunity to learn about company skills as services that may be combined to create more complex operations.

3. Define Microservices.
= Microservice is an architecture that was used by small teams and has small independent services. This architecture also operates as an independent service that hides functionality into a modular service. The architecture aims to meet the need for the features that it offers in applications.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.

-1. Improved Scalability - microservices made it easier to select appropriate tech stack for every component without stressing about incompatibility, as the services in microservices can be developed using different languages.
-2. Better resiliency - with microservice architecture, this makes it easy to identify the failure and issues to the performance.
-3. Improved productivity - microservices are easier to build and maintain as the application are into smaller and independent pieces.
-4. Continuous integration/continuous delivery - microservices architetcure speeds up the deployment and troubleshooting process as it allow teams to test, to fix issues, to deploy and to upgrade services independently.
-5. Optimize business functionality - customizing the requirements of each components to enhance business functionality is made simpler.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
*SIMILARITIES*
-both SOA and microservices can allow teams to test, to fix issues, to deploy and to upgrade services independently.
-both of them are loosely coupled.

*DIFFERENCES*
-Microservices are based on limited setting, whereas SOA is focused on sharing components.
-SOA and Microservices are differ when it comes to Reusability and Data Duplication. SOA, where components are being reuse to enhance efficiency. While microservices, instead of reusing of components, it duplicate the data for maintaining efficiency and independency.
